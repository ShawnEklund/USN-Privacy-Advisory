## Cookies and Navy.mil

What is a Cookie? Whenever you visit a website the website sends a small piece of information called a cookie along with the webpage. The main purpose of a cookie is to identify and customize webpages for you.

There are two kinds of cookies. A session cookie (Tier 1) is a line of text that is stored temporarily in your computer’s random access memory (RAM). A session cookie is never written to a drive, and it is destroyed as soon as you close your browser. 

A persistent cookie (Tier 2) from a website is saved to a file on your hard drive and is called up the next time you visit that website. This allows the website to remember what you were interested in the last time you visited.

The U.S. Navy does not use the information associated with cookies to track individual user activity on the Internet outside U.S. Navy websites, nor does it share the data obtained through such technologies with other departments or agencies without the user’s explicit consent. The U.S. Navy does not keep a database of information obtained from the use of cookies. Use of these cookies does not involve the collection of a visitor's PII.

## Use of Cookies on navy.mil: 
Navy.mil creates a session cookie when you visit and destroys it as soon as you close your browser.

Akamai is a service that software speeds the delivery of content and applications for customers through using automatic, intermediate, and temporary information storage to make the onward transmission of that information to other recipients more efficient. Temporary storage processes retain information only so long as is reasonably necessary to transmit the data. Intermediate storage processes retain information only so long as is reasonably necessary for continued transmission, to maintain the security of the network and the data, to monitor and improve website performance, for related administrative purposes. Akamai does not collect, use, or disclose PII.

Foresee Results survey software measures user satisfaction and assesses website effectiveness through optional surveys presented to website visitors. The information gathered from these surveys is used to identify and prioritize improvements to functional website elements and content for an improved visitor experience. Survey participants provide ratings and feedback related to a series of questions about website performance, aesthetics, usability, and the user experience; however, participants are not required to provide any PII. Tier 2 cookies are used to remember if the user has already been offered the survey and to ensure that users are prompted only once every 60 days.

Urchin software collects aggregate statistics of website visitor characteristics, traffic, and activity. This information is used to assess what content is of most and least interest, determine technical design specifications, and identify system performance or problem areas. The software records a variety of data, including IP addresses (the locations of computers or networks on the Internet), unique visits, page views, hits, referring websites, and which hyperlinks have been clicked.

Google Analytics as configured on navy.mil also uses first-party (persistent) cookies to:

* Distinguish unique users (cookies will remain on your computer for up to 2 years unless you clear the cookies)
* Throttle the request rate (last for up to 1 minute)

Google Analytics collects and stores information about your visit to our site. This information includes:

## Use of Third-Party Websites and Applications
Third-party websites and applications that are not owned, operated, or controlled by the U.S. Navy are integral to Internet-based operations across the U.S. Navy and used to augment official communication. These capabilities include, but are not limited to, networking services, media sharing services, wikis and data mashups. A list of the U.S. Navy’s authorized pages and uses of these services is listed at http://www.navy.mil/CommandDirectory.asp. These third-party sites may collect PII and may make it available to the U.S. Navy and other users; however, the PII is not collected on behalf of, nor is it provided specifically for, the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Navy does not harvest and additionally collect, maintain, share or otherwise use such PII for any purpose other than that for which it is made available to all users.
